          <li>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) creates the structure of the webpage. It's composed of elements which work together to provide content and a basic framework for all your pages on the web</li>
          <li>Elements can be used to divide the content on the page and to describe the content to browsers and other developers</li>
          <li>You can think of HTML as the frame of our websites. Each HTML element performs a unique role (e.g., head and body)</li>

            <li>CSS adds style to our webpage. Similar to how HTML is the frame/foundation of a house, CSS is the interior and exterior designer</li>
            <li>You can include CSS in your HTML through in-line styling, id, class, and/or element types, which is in order of priority (e.g., in-line styling will appear over class styling for a particular element)</li>
            <li>CSS code uses a selector (e.g., div) followed by a curly bracket and then a CSS property and a value (e.g., div {color: blue}, which is called a declaration)</li>

            <li>Git is a version control system to manage and keep track of each version of your project, which we can use through the command line</li>
            <li>Through Git, we can connect to our GitHub repositories, make changes to them, and keep them in sync with our local environment</li>
            <li>Git is useful for developers because it allows us to keep track of changes to the code base and revert back to prior versions in case of an issue</li>
            <li>A good resource for different git commands is <a href="https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf">Git Cheat Sheet</a></li>

            <li>JavaScript is a high-level dynamic programming language that allows users to interact with websites. It takes static HTML/CSS and makes it interactive</li>
            <li>Similar to the house analogy, you can think of JavaScript as language that makes your home a smart home</li>
            <li>It allows you to include things such as conditional logic, arrays, loops, functions, etc.</li>
